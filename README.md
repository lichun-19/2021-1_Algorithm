In 2021 fall semester, I took the "Algorithm" opened by Prof.江蕙如. We learnt about sorting methods, time complexity, dynamic programming, graphs, and data structure.
We were given the requirements(see in doc) of the corresponding programming assignments, and tried to solve the problem on our own.
We should design a problem and applied what we learnt during the semester in DIY problem. I simplified the model of Taiwan map and attempted to find out the "safest" path traveling around this island during pandemic.
